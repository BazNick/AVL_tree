# AVL_tree
AVL tree realisation using Python 3

In this realisation of AVL tree I have the following methods:
- create nodes in the tree (the tree creates nodes and checks it self to keep the tree balanced);
- find height of the tree;
- search nodes in the tree;
- display all nodes in the tree;
- delete nodes in the tree (keeping the tree balanced);
- display number of all nodes in the tree;
